It's been tough, taking shortcuts
Tricks up my sleeve, been flat out last week
And I got rich friends, they're all brainwashed
And they don't care and I care too much
I, I never wanted to feel
That we were on different sides
I guess this makes us real, but not right
If you don't think it matters
Yeah, traumatic iconic, can't get enough of it
Yeah, brain is panoramic, can't take my eyes off it
I'll give you everything if you ask
I'll give you everything if you ask me
Spell it out, don't talk so fast
You know that I can't give you that
Who you gonna fall for now? (Who you gonna fall for now?)
Anyone in this crowd? (Anyone in this crowd?)
Say your feelings out loud (say your feelings out loud)
Teen angst to make you proud (teen angst to make you proud)
I don't think it matters
Yeah, traumatic iconic, can't get enough of it
Yeah, brain is panoramic, can't take my eyes off it
Are we pulling you into tomorrow?
Thanks for nothing, can't let go ,so
Yeah, traumatic iconic, can't get enough of it
And I never wanted to feel
We were on different sides
On the same page last week
Repeating every line
And the weather's spinning
And it happens all the time
Yes, I confess my witness
Was you across the line
Yeah, traumatic iconic, can't get enough of it
Yeah, brain is panoramic, can't take my eyes off it
Are we pulling you into tomorrow? (Tomorrow)
Thanks for nothing, can't let go, so
Yeah, traumatic iconic, can't get enough of it
