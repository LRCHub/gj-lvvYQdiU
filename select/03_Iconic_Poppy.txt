You gotta be iconic
You gotta be iconic
You go around where the danger goes
And you feel ready for anything (Uh)
Your heels are keeping you on your toes
And you won't stop at anything (Uh)
Don't let them ever see you sweat
Go hard, baby, no regrets
Take it to the limit and then push it
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah
Don't let them ever see you sweat
Go hard, baby, no regrets
Take it to the limit and then push it
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah
You don't have to be flawless
Put on a little polish
Run the bedroom to the office
You gotta be iconic
In school, they never taught it
Don't worry, babe, I got you
And if you really, really want it
You gotta be iconic (Iconic, iconic-conic)
Put on your mostest romantic clothes
And you'll be ready for anything (Uh)
People might say you're a weirdo, might call you a freak (Freak)
If they do just tell them you're in real good company (Uh)
Don't let them ever see you sweat
Go hard, baby, no regrets
Take it to the limit and then push it
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah
Don't let them ever see you sweat
Go hard, baby, no regrets
Take it to the limit and then push it
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah
You don't have to be flawless
Put on a little polish
Run the bedroom to the office
You gotta be iconic
In school, they never taught it
Don't worry, babe, I got you
And if you really, really want it
You gotta be iconic (Iconic, iconic-conic)
Iconic, iconic-conic

You gotta be iconic
In school, they never taught it
